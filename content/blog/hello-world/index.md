After speaking with [Professor Marcus Botacin](https://marcusbotacin.github.io/), I decided to create this site so share my learnings from the seminars in [CSCE 689: Machine Learned Based CyberDefenses](https://marcusbotacin.github.io/teaching/ml-1). Rather than keeping the knowledge behind closed doors, anyone and everyone can access what I have learned in the seminars for this class.

The domain for this site is 'ml-to-cs', which is intended to mean: Machine Learned Applied to Cyber Security.
